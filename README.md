### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer contributing to the Data & ML Platforms team at MongoDB to help build the in-house ML Infrastructure, building Feature Store from scratch, enhancing the Model Deployment and Model Integration Services, etc.

Before this, I was responsible for setting up the AI Capability at Koverhoop, leading Search, MLOps, and Infrastructure.

At Koverhoop, I developed the entire Product Infrastructure from scratch
- Built a low latency search capability through real-time data denormalization using kafka, and elasticsearch
- Built ML models in the Insurance domain, optimizing sales time and extracting information from lengthy contracts.
- Designed a novel multi-level text annotation system called Astronaut to create Fine-Grained NER datasets.

I blog about Distributed Systems, ML, and Infrastructure.

I'm highly invested in Personal Growth and Well-being. 

I can speak English, Hindi, and Dutch.
