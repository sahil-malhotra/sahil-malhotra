### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm an experienced Data Scientist and an Engineer specializing in NLP and Explainable AI, responsible to set up the AI Capability at Koverhoop, leading all Developer Operations, engineering ETL pipelines, and ML pipelines to allow models into production and create an actual impact.

At Koverhoop, I lead the development of the entire Data Infrastructure from Real-time Stream Processing ETL, to ML Pipelines and Business Intelligence; to enable Search Capability, Democratise Data, and Deploy Models.

I am actively involved with the companyâ€™s executives to help in translating business problems to analytics problems. Since then, I have been working to solve problems in the insurance, and real estate domains.

Weâ€™ve been building models and engineering tools:

â—¾ In the Insurance domain, optimizing sales time and extracting information from lengthy contracts.

â—¾ For building stream-processing pipelines to denormalize relational data on-the-fly, and load it into elastic search to enable a search capability

â—¾ For doing multi-level text annotation, building a novel open-source annotation tool, Astronaut.
